# js-ext

> A collection of useful JavaScript functions

instead of having to create helper functions for every project, I decided to create a library of useful functions that I can use in any project.
bard recommended i use lodash or a similar library, but i wanted to create my own library for fun. and utilize javascript's prototype system to avoid having to import functions from a library.

## Install

```bash
bun i @mohamedbechirmejri/js-ext
```

## Usage

```js
import init from "@mohamedbechirmejri/js-ext";

init({ ignore: [] });

"test".CAPITALIZE(); // Test
```

the lib shouldn't be used now since it's still in development. docs will be added once the lib is ready for use.
